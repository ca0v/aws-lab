# AWS-LAB

Here I track my learning progress in Amazon Web Services.

## AWS - IAM

* Used identity and access management to create a user and give it access to the AWS console as well as S3 buckets.

* Created an S3 Bucket

* Wrote code to read and write "notes.txt" to the S3 bucket

## AWS - Lambda

* Created a lambda function and called it from local desktop (invoke_lambda.js)
